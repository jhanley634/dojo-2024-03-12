Greetings!
I am John Hanley.

<https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhanley714>

In the 20th century I helped Oracle and Yahoo build large systems
for serving the burgeoning masses of internet clients.

Welcome to the 21st century.
I hope you're enjoying it.
Lately I have worked as a Researcher at Xerox PARC
(the storied Palo Alto Research Center),
and as Senior Data Scientist at REX, a real estate startup.

I use python.

With any luck, you do, too!

(Currently seeking new opportunities -- you or your manager might reach out.)
